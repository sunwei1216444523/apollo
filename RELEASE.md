# Release 10.0

In Apollo 8.0, the concept of package management tailored for user learning scenarios was introduced to enable users to deploy and use Apollo more conveniently and efficiently. In Apollo 9.0, the package management tool was updated to Version 2.0, making it easier for users to conduct secondary development and effortlessly build their own autonomous driving applications based on Apollo. In Apollo 10.0, we realize that autonomous driving cannot remain at the stage of local validation. Instead, it requires a comprehensive upgrade, and needs to be applied to scenarios on a large scale. In terms of performance, the performance and stability of various layers and modules are optimied, and extensive tools are provided to improve optimization efficiency. At the cost level, the hardware costs are recuded by enriching the hardware ecosystem which provides users with more options. Besides, the software development costs are lowered by upgrading the operating system, establishing communication with other frameworks, and reusing ecological software capabilities. Regarding safety, functional safety strategies and functional safety framework capabilities are reinforced.

## Major New Features and Improvements:

Better performance and enhanced stability to comprehensively reinforce Apollo's autonomous driving capabilities

- CyberRT Framework Upgrade: With industry-leading framework capabilities, low latency and low consumption, the performance is improved by 10 times, and the communication is more reliable. Apollo 10.0 features zero-copy communication, which ensures high performance and low consumption and achieves microsecond-level transmission latency. During inter-process communication, message are read and written directly on shared memory, avoiding memory copying, serialization, deserialization, and other resource-intensive operations. See [CyberRT Performance Report](docs/%E9%99%84%E5%BD%95/CyberRT%20Performance%20Report.md) for more details.
- Comprehensive and Detailed Performance Analysis Tool: It empowers developers to create high-quality autonomous driving system applications. Five key resources including CPU, GPU, memory, graphics memory, and IO are comprehensively monitored and tracked in real time with a visual interface to identify issues immediately. Function-level analysis capabilities ensure precise localization. Intuitively analysis of resource consumption distribution at the function-level granularity helps developers conduct in-depth optimizations to improve performance. See [Cyber RT Performance Analysis Tool](docs/%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83/CyberRT/Cyber%20RT%20Performance%20Analysis%20Tool.md) for more details.

Stronger capabilities, More various ecological support to significantly reduce R&D costs for both software and hardware

- Pure Vision Perception Solution with Low Cost and High Ceiling: The mainstream perception paradigms of visual BEV (Bird's Eye View) object detection and occupancy network are introduced into the Apollo open-source framework, and optimizations are performed based on industry-standard models, with each paradigm surpassing the industry-standard models in performance. Deployment is also extensively optimized, and now the inference frame rate can reach 5Hz on a single Orin platform. See [The Introduction and tutorials of vision object detection and occpancy prediction model](docs/%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Apollo%E6%84%9F%E7%9F%A5%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/%E6%84%9F%E7%9F%A5%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E8%AE%AD%E7%BB%83/The_introduction_and_tutorials_of_vision_obejct_detection_and_occpancy_prediction_model.md) for more details.
- Various Software Ecosystem and Accelerated Iteration Efficiency to Reduce Software Development and Deployment Costs: By integrating with the ROS ecosystem at the framework level, software reuse costs are lowered, R&D efficiency is enhanced, and more use scenarios are catered. The plugin engineering design simplifies expansion. Meanwhile, typical universal modules are ready to use at zero cost, while modules with customized capabilities can be integrated at low cost through conversion. Besides, it is more convenient and efficient to directly install and deploy multiple system versions on physical machines. Also, the deployment tool offers one-click packaging, enabling batch deployment of secondary development components. See [Cyber RT Communication with ROS](docs/%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83/CyberRT/Cyber%20RT%20Communication%20with%20ROS.md) and [Installation Guide](docs/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/Installation%20Guide.md) for more details.
- Broader Hardware Ecosystem Support Offering More Options and More Suitable Scenarios to Reduce Hardware Selection Costs: An industry-leading hardware ecosystem is built through collaborations with over 32 manufacturers, supporting more than 73 devices and adding over 20 new models in our list. Particularly, the number of core devices (such as domain controllers, LiDARs, and inertial navigation systems) has doubled or tripled. We also provide a new hardware adaptation guide. All these provide a more convenient access mechanism for hardware ecosystem partners to connect with a broader market, fostering a collaborative ecosystem model.

Comprehensive Safety Coverage for More Stable and Reliable Autonomous Driving

- Compliance with Industry Safety Standards for Autonomous Driving: Functional safety software modules are designed and implemented based on relevant standards and specifications in ISO 26262 Road vehicles – Functional safety and ISO 21448 Road vehicles – Safety of the intended functionality.
- Comprehensive Functional Safety Strategies: These include hardware safety monitoring of sensors, computing units, chassis, vehicles, and other related components; full-link anomaly monitoring of sensor input to perception, prediction, planning, control, and chassis communication modules; runtime dependency environment anomaly monitoring, including system anomalies, resource occupancy, network, and IO; and independent capabilities for detecting collisions, traffic rule violations, and accidents.
- Robust Functional Safety Framework: With various detection items and easy expandability, the framework offers access standards for users to customize detection items at low cost. Besides, it is highly real-time, taking less than 1ms from anomaly detection to MRC (Minimum Risk Condition) strategy implementation. Meanwhile, it boasts diverse MRC strategy capabilities, with built-in configurations such as warnings, gentle braking, and emergency braking, and suopports custom development.
